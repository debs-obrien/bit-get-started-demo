description: A Title
labels: ['react', 'typescript', 'title']
---

import { Title } from './title';

* Place buttons where expect to find them. Do not force users to "hunt for buttons".
* Do not use generic for your buttons. Use verbs that clearly explain the button's function.
* Size buttons in proportion to their importance.


### Using the 'title' component
```jsx live=true
<Title >This is a title</Title>
```
